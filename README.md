Welcome to my Repo

You need to keep in mind i am using 2 env databases.
.env.test
.env.development
containing 
nc_games & nc_games_test respectfully!
these databases need to be created in order for the code to work!
Demonstrating simple api calls


These databases hold dear information i am about to put in good use , using my seed.js file to populate them!
